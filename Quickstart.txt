Clone this repository and the main repository (https://github.com/ahnt/MABE) onto your local machine.

Place the ChemotaxisWorld folder into the /MABE/World folder.

Go back into the /MABE/ directory and edit the file named buildOptions.txt.

Place  “+ Chemotaxis” [without quotes] below the % World heading.

Open your terminal and navigate to the /MABE/ directory.

Enter the command: python3 ./PythonTools/Mbuild.py

Once compiling is finished, copy the executable to another directory.

Open your terminal in that directory and enter ./MABE -s 

This will generate the settings files for MABE. 

Open the settings_world.cfg file in a text editor, and edit it so that worldType = Chemotaxis

You can now run MABE by entering ./MABE -f *.cfg

For details on the settings files, see the MABE wiki located on the GitHub page.
